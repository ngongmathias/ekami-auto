Hi! I'm continuing development on my Ekami Auto luxury car rental platform.

**Project Location:** `C:\Users\Hp\ekamiauto\CascadeProjects\windsurf-project\ekami-cars`

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Phase 1 (MVP) is 100% COMPLETE - All 8 features working
- 🚧 Phase 2 needs to be built - 8 new features (CURRENT FOCUS)
- ⏳ Phase 3 planned - 17+ premium features (AI, maps, mobile app)
- ⏳ Phase 4 planned - Scale & optimization

**What's Already Done (Phase 1):**
1. ✅ Car Detail Page - Full specs, gallery, pricing
2. ✅ Rent Page - Advanced filters, search, pagination
3. ✅ Booking System - Date picker, price calculator
4. ✅ Payment Integration - Stripe + Mobile Money (MTN/Orange)
5. ✅ User Dashboard - Bookings, favorites, loyalty points
6. ✅ Admin Dashboard - Full CRUD for cars, bookings, customers, blog
7. ✅ Email Notifications - Resend integration (API key configured)
8. ✅ Contact Page - Form with WhatsApp integration

**Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Supabase database (8 tables, RLS policies set up)
- ✅ Clerk authentication (configured)
- ✅ Resend email service (API key: re_DHxyYtzz_BAwiry1tnVgaUJCm3FoJRzTA)
- ✅ Stripe payments (test mode)
- ✅ Mobile Money integration
- ✅ Dark mode + Multi-language (EN/FR)
- ✅ All routes configured in App.tsx

**What I Need You to Build (Phase 2 - 8 Features):**

1. **Buy Page** - Car sales listings with financing calculator
2. **Repairs Service** - Service request form with photo upload
3. **Sell Your Car** - Multi-step wizard to submit cars for sale
4. **Reviews & Ratings** - Star rating system for cars
5. **Enhanced Blog** - Rich text editor with categories
6. **Car Comparison** - Compare up to 3 cars side-by-side
7. **Advanced Search** - Global search with autocomplete
8. **WhatsApp Enhanced** - Floating chat button with context-aware messages

**Important Details:**
- All database tables already exist in Supabase
- Follow existing design patterns (luxury theme: gold/silver/charcoal)
- Maintain dark mode support
- Use existing components where possible
- Quality is the top priority - no compromises

**Reference Document:**
Please read `PHASE_2_HANDOFF.md` in the project root for complete specifications, database schema, component structure, and build order.

**Build Order (Recommended):**
1. WhatsApp Enhanced (quick win)
2. Buy Page (high priority)
3. Reviews & Ratings (high value)
4. Car Comparison (unique feature)
5. Repairs Service
6. Sell Your Car
7. Advanced Search
8. Enhanced Blog

**My Preferences:**
- Time is not a concern - quality is everything
- Build features completely, don't rush
- Add polish and animations
- Make it production-ready
- Test thoroughly

Please start by:
1. Reading the PHASE_2_HANDOFF.md file
2. Confirming you understand the requirements
3. Beginning with the WhatsApp Enhanced feature (easiest first)

Let me know when you're ready to start building! 🚀
